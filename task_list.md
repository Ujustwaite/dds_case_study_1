# unique(Teamname) Case Study 01 Todo List

## Some organizing thoughts and framework for task assignment

### 1. Questions: 

As agreed, we'll all take a stab at the specific questions in the text and select from best-of-breed answers. This will allow us each to experience building the answers / working with the data. Out of this, though, we'll need to agree to some standard variable names / etc. 

### 2. Other implied tasks: 

* Agree on a repository location to work from. 
    + Need to have every individual participate in the pull / push to the repository so that participation is logged. 

* Clean the data: 
    + Agree on tidy variable names (needs to address the two name fields (brewery name and beer name) in each data set)
    + Remove the leading spaces from the States column in Breweries
    + Set a common name for the Brewery_id to merge on
    
* Answer the questions 
    + Needs to be explicitly answered in a sentence outside of the code chunk. 

* Figure out the plots. 
    + Make them pretty :-) 
    
* Agree upon a format / method for building the rMarkdown document

* Write a codebook describing all of the above

* Build a powerpoint presentation to capture the above (or demo live on the Repo) 
    + Probably safer to use ppt. 
    
### 3. Meetings

Seems like we're all generally available in the same windows and that Slack is a good coordination option. We can probably get together by Connect at least once or twice, but I'd have to figure out how to access my own room (assuming I have one). Can meet up in other forums as you are available. 

Feel free to modify or add to any of the above!
